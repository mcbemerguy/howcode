# Developer notes

## Stack

- Bun for installs/scripts
- Node.js 24 LTS runtime target
- Electron
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3`

## Local development

This repo pins the local development runtime in `.node-version`. Use that Node version before installing or running hooks; with fnm this happens automatically after `fnm env --use-on-cd` is loaded.

```bash
fnm install
bun install
bun run dev
```

`bun install` rebuilds Electron native dependencies, then restores the root `node_modules` native files for the pinned stock Node runtime used by tests and the desktop service. `bun run ai:check` also verifies those native files before running Vitest.

## Common commands

```bash
bun run build
bun run build:release
bun run build:launcher-artifacts
bun run release:prepare
bun run publish:howcode:dry-run
```

## Release flow

Build release artifacts:

```bash
bun run release:prepare
```

This produces:

- `artifacts/electron/` — Electron unpacked release artifacts
- `artifacts/electron/*.AppImage` — Linux AppImage artifacts on Linux builds
- `artifacts/npm-launcher/` — launcher archives consumed by the npm package

For a GitHub release, upload both:

- `stable-<os>-<arch>-update.json`
- Electron unpacked bundle artifacts
- Linux `.AppImage` artifacts
- `howcode-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz`

Launcher base URL:

- `https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howcode/releases/latest/download`

GitHub workflow:

- push a tag like `v0.1.0` to build all release artifacts and publish a GitHub release automatically

## NPM launcher package

The user-facing npm package lives in:

- `packages/howcode`

It is a thin launcher that:

1. resolves the latest GitHub release metadata
2. downloads the matching platform archive on first run
3. caches it locally
4. launches the packaged desktop app

Desktop release builds bundle Electron with Chromium on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Repo map

- `src/app/*` — renderer app
- `src/electron/*` — Electron main and preload layers
- `desktop/*` — desktop runtime lanes
- `shared/*` — shared contracts and helpers
- `packages/howcode/*` — npm launcher package
- `scripts/*` — build and packaging scripts

## Checks and hooks

Main checks:

```bash
bun run ai:check
bun run check
```

Hooks:

- `.husky/pre-commit` — lint-staged, then `bun run ai:check`
- `.husky/pre-push` — clean build outputs, then `bun run ai:check`
